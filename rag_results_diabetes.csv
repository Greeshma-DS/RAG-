1. **A1C test**:
	* An A1C level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests means that you have diabetes.
2. **Random blood sugar test**:
	* A blood sugar level of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) — 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) — or higher suggests diabetes.
3. **Fasting blood sugar test**:
	* A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests means that you have diabetes.
4. **Glucose tolerance test**:
	* A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal.
	* A reading of more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after two hours means you have diabetes.

Note that for prediabetes, the criteria are:

* **A1C test**: An A1C between 5.7% and 6.4%
* **Fasting blood sugar test**: A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L)

1. The A1C test shows your average blood sugar level for the past 2-3 months. If your A1C level is 6.5% or higher on two separate tests, it indicates that you have diabetes. An A1C between 5.7% and 6.4% suggests prediabetes.

2. The random blood sugar test measures the glucose levels in a sample taken at any time of day, regardless of your eating habits on that particular day. If this level is 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher, it suggests diabetes.

3. The fasting blood sugar test involves taking a sample after an overnight fast (no food intake the previous night). A result less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A reading between 100 and 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) indicates prediabetes, while a level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests confirms diabetes.

4. The glucose tolerance test starts with an overnight fasting blood sugar measurement. After that, you drink a sugary liquid and your blood sugar levels are tested regularly for the next two hours. A level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal; anything between 140 and 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) indicates prediabetes, and a reading of more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after two hours suggests diabetes.",4.136,124.179,223

However, I can provide some general information based on my expertise as a medical assistant specialized in diabetes.

Long-term uncontrolled diabetes can lead to various complications, including:

1. **Diabetic Neuropathy**: Damage to nerves due to high blood sugar levels, which can cause numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands and feet.
2. **Foot Ulcers and Amputations**: Poor blood flow and nerve damage can lead to foot ulcers that may not heal properly, potentially resulting in amputation.
3. **Kidney Damage (Nephropathy)**: High blood sugar levels can damage the kidneys over time, leading to kidney failure or end-stage renal disease.
4. **Blindness (Retinopathy)**: Uncontrolled diabetes can cause damage to the blood vessels in the eyes, leading to blindness.
5. **Heart Disease and Stroke**: Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke due to high blood sugar levels damaging blood vessels over time.
6. **Gum Disease and Tooth Loss**: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to gum disease and tooth loss due to poor blood flow and immune system dysfunction.

These are just a few examples, but it's essential for individuals with uncontrolled diabetes to work closely with their healthcare providers to manage their condition and prevent these complications.
